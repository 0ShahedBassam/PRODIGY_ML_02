# Introduction
This report documents the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The implementation follows a standard
machine learning pipeline: environment setup, data acquisition, preprocessing, feature
extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
The goal was to build an SVM model that can accurately classify images as either
containing a cat or a dog. This is a binary classification problem that serves as a good
benchmark for image classification techniques.
Environment Setup
First, we set up the environment by creating a project directory and installing the
necessary libraries.

    # Create project directory
    mkdir -p cat_dog_classification
    cd cat_dog_classification
    # Install required libraries
    pip3 install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pillow kaggle tqdm

Additional libraries were installed later as needed:

    # For dataset download from Hugging Face
    pip3 install datasets transformers
    # For visualization
    pip3 install seaborn
# Dataset Acquisition

Initially, we planned to use the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats dataset. However, since Kaggle
credentials weren't available, we used Hugging Face as an alternative source.

      download_dataset()
# Execution and Results

When executed, the script successfully downloaded and saved: - 18,728 training images
(split into cat and dog subdirectories) - 4,682 test images

# Image Preprocessing

After downloading the dataset, we preprocessed the images to prepare them for feature
extraction. This involved resizing the images to a consistent size and optionally
converting them to grayscale.

# Feature Extraction

After preprocessing, we extracted features from the images. Due to memory constraints,
we implemented a memory-efficient approach using IncrementalPCA, reduced image
dimensions, and batch processing.

# Results Visualization

The evaluation generated several visualizations to help understand the model's
performance:

Confusion Matrix

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88fe9b9b-b513-4143-a5c3-5e907e84aa0b)

The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly classified 292 cat images and 301 dog images, while misclassifying 208 cat images and 199 dog images. This indicates balanced performance across both classes.

ROC Curve

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/973d72ff-b91b-40ee-8ffc-53bfdc5b2400)

The ROC curve shows the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. The AUC (Area Under Curve) of 0.63 indicates performance better than random chance (0.5).

Precision-Recall Curve

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/707c0d78-11e7-4d61-8fd8-34a565b99847)

The precision-recall curve shows the trade-off between precision and recall. The average precision of 0.63 is consistent with the overall accuracy.

Learning Curve

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/036da7d8-5c22-4b0c-ba7e-9170669ff225)

The learning curve shows a gap between training and cross-validation scores, indicating some overfitting. However, the cross-validation score improves with more training data, suggesting that more data could help improve performance

# Model Analysis
Based on the evaluation, we identified several limitations and potential improvements:

# Limitations
1.	The accuracy of 59.3% is modest for a binary classification task
2.	The model may be underfitting due to the simplified feature representation
3.	The grayscale conversion and dimensionality reduction may have lost important color information
4.	SVMs may not be the optimal algorithm for complex image classification tasks

# Potential Improvements
1.	Use color features instead of grayscale to retain color information

2.	Try different feature extraction methods like HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
3.	Explore more hyperparameter combinations with a more extensive grid search
4.	Use more training data (we limited to 5000 images due to memory constraints)
5.	Consider using deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
6.	Apply more sophisticated data augmentation techniques
7.	Try ensemble methods combining multiple models

# Conclusion and Future Improvements
This implementation demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machines for image classification tasks. While the model achieves modest performance with 59.3% accuracy, it provides a solid baseline and foundation for further improvements.
The analysis suggests that more sophisticated feature extraction methods, additional training data, and potentially different algorithms like CNNs could significantly improve performance for this task.
The learning curve indicates that the model would benefit from more training data, and the balanced performance across classes suggests that the approach is sound but limited by the simplified feature representation.
For production-level performance, deep learning approaches would likely be more suitable for this complex image classification task.

# Key Findings:
1.	SVMs can be used for image classification but have limitations for complex visual tasks
2.	Feature extraction and representation are crucial for SVM performance
3.	Memory-efficient approaches like IncrementalPCA can help handle large image datasets
4.	The model achieved 59.3% accuracy, which is modest but above random chance
5.	The performance is balanced across both cat and dog classes
6.	The learning curve suggests that more training data would improve performance
7.	Color information and more sophisticated feature extraction could enhance results
8.	Deep learning approaches would likely outperform traditional SVMs for this task
